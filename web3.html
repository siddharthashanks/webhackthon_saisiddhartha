     <h1>American Pyscho </h1>
     <p><em>In 1987, Patrick Bateman, a young and wealthy New York City investment banker, spends most of his time dining at popular restaurants while keeping up appearances for his fianc√©e Evelyn Williams and his circle of wealthy associates, most of whom he despises. At a business meeting, Bateman and his associates flaunt their business cards, focusing on their design and style. Enraged by the superiority of his colleague Paul Allen's card, Bateman confronts a homeless man in an alley at night and stabs him and stomps his dog to death. Bateman and Allen, who mistakes Bateman for another co-worker, make plans for dinner after a Christmas party. Bateman resents Allen for his affluent lifestyle and ability to obtain reservations at Dorsia, an exclusive restaurant that Bateman is unable to get reservations at. Bateman manipulates Allen into getting drunk. He lures Allen into his apartment and kills him with an axe while listening to Huey Lewis and the News. Bateman goes into Allen's apartment and leaves a message on his answering machine claiming that Allen has gone on a business trip to London.</em></p>
